Designed an experiment to measure the radiation force exerted by a pulsed laser beam using a capacitance interferometer, using apparatus available in an undergraduate electronics laboratory. Assembled a PCB with a capacitance bridge and an Op-Amp amplifier for the detection of mechanical resonances of a brass cantilever forced using a pulsed laser, allowing for measurement of radiation force.
